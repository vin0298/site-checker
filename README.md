## Python Project  
A simple web crawler that looks for external URLs of a website.  
This program takes at least 1 arguments:  
- The first argument is the base_URL for the crawler to start crawling. It must
be the base to ensure it is able to access robots.txt file and obey it.  
- Optional arguments would be the URLs that you want the crawler to look out for
as external links.
